# Oil-Price-Hedging
Oil Price Hedging using Gated Recurrent Unit. A deep learning model to predict the weekly price of oil using Technical Trading Ratios (TTR) and Candlestick Patterns. 

Oil is a Volatile commodity that is affected by geo-political tension, tranportation pipelines and such. Due to which it's price fluctuates heavily. Oil price also influences the growth, development and economies of countries. If we predict it accurately, traders might be able to diversify their investments based on this knowledge.

But to predict it accurately we would require data about world indicatore weekly, weekly commodity prices and more which might be difficult to access. So, we've used the weekly open, high, low, close, volume of oil and w've created TTR for this and also indicators for candlestick patterns and used that as input variables to predict the price using Gated Recurrent Unit.
